# Context + useReducer over Direct AsyncStorage Access

In building this inventory management system, one of the key architectural decisions was implementing a state management layer using React Context and a dispatch pattern rather than directly accessing AsyncStorage throughout the application. This abstraction provides several significant benefits:

## Benefits

### Single source of truth, State synchronization

- Prevents scattered AsyncStorage calls throughout the application
- Makes it easier to debug and maintain storage-related operations because all AsyncStorage operations are centralized in one place
- Provides immediate UI updates while storage operations happen in the background
- Type safety throughout the application
